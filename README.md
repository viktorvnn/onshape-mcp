# Onshape MCP

AI-assisted access to your Onshape CAD documents.

## What This Is

Onshape MCP connects your AI assistant to Onshape. You describe what you want
in Onshape terms — create a sketch, extrude a part, export an STL — and the AI
handles the API calls. This is a helper for people who already know Onshape,
not a replacement for CAD skills.

## Status

Early development. This is offered for people to try if they're interested —
things may not always work as expected, and feedback is appreciated.

This project does not provide a public hosted MCP server or a public OAuth
proxy. Run it locally, self-host it, or connect to a server operated by someone
you independently trust.

## Getting Started

### Local Setup (Claude Desktop, OpenCode, or any MCP client)

This is the recommended path. A local server can read and write files on your
machine directly — screenshots, exports, and FeatureScript — instead of passing
content through the conversation.

**Step 1: Create an Onshape OAuth application**

Create your own OAuth application in Onshape with
`http://localhost:18338/callback` as a redirect URL. Keep its client ID and
client secret available for `onshape-mcp auth login`. Direct OAuth with these
user-owned credentials is the default. API access and secret keys are also
supported as an alternative; see
[Authentication](docs/src/project/authentication.md).

**Step 2: Get the server binary**

Pick whichever is easier for you:

- **npx** (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)): No separate install
  needed — your MCP client runs `npx --yes onshape-mcp` and it downloads
  automatically.
- **Pre-built binary**: Download from
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/altendky/onshape-mcp/releases) and save
  it somewhere convenient.

**Step 3: Configure your MCP client**

Tell your MCP client how to launch the server.

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

Using npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onshape": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "onshape-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Using the downloaded binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onshape": {
      "command": "/path/to/onshape-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### OpenCode

Add to your `opencode.json`:

Using npx:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "onshape": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "--yes", "onshape-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Using the downloaded binary:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "onshape": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["/path/to/onshape-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Other MCP clients

Any MCP client that supports stdio transport can launch this server. The command
is either `npx --yes onshape-mcp` or the path to the downloaded binary.

**Step 4: Authenticate and try it**

Configure your OAuth client ID and secret, then run
`npx --yes onshape-mcp auth login` when using the npm package, or
`onshape-mcp auth login` when using the downloaded binary.
Prefer configuration or `ONSHAPE_MCP_AUTH__CLIENT_ID` and
`ONSHAPE_MCP_AUTH__CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. The supported
`--client-id` and `--client-secret` flags may expose secrets in shell history or
process listings. Restart or start your MCP client, then ask your AI assistant
to create a new Onshape document with a simple shape.

### Company-hosted server

For an engineering team, use the hardened single-server deployment in
[`deploy/enterprise/`](deploy/enterprise/README.md). It provides TLS, per-user
Onshape OAuth, equal access for every authenticated user, encrypted
restart-persistent OAuth state, request bounds, security headers, health checks,
and audit events. It deliberately runs one application replica; active-active
deployment requires a transactional shared state backend.

The MCP client URL is `https://<your-domain>/mcp`. This project does not provide
a publicly operated endpoint. The operator must own the Onshape OAuth
application and is responsible for access review, backups, log retention,
monitoring, rate limiting, and incident response.

HTTP transport deliberately disables MCP file reads and writes. File-reference
arguments and local output paths therefore cannot access your computer; provide
supported request content inline and retrieve remote results through the tool
response instead.

## Tips

- **Share document URLs.** Paste an Onshape document URL into the conversation
  to give the AI context about what you're working with.
- **Use Onshape vocabulary.** Say "extrude," "fillet," "sketch on the top
  face," etc. The AI has built-in knowledge about Onshape operations.
- **Multiple steps are normal.** The AI discovers API endpoints dynamically, so
  a single request may involve several steps behind the scenes.
- **Be specific when things go wrong.** If the AI takes a wrong turn, try
  describing the Onshape operation more precisely.

## What You Can Do

- Browse and explore your Onshape documents
- Create new documents and parts
- Build features: sketches, extrudes, revolves, sweeps, fillets, construction
  planes
- Take screenshots of Part Studios from different angles
- Export parts (STL, STEP, and other formats)
- Work with FeatureScript — write custom features and debug existing ones

The AI has access to the full Onshape REST API, so anything available through
the API is potentially reachable. Results will vary — some operations work more
reliably than others at this stage.
